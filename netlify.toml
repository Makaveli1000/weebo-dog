  # CRITICAL FIX: Simplified command.
  # Now it ONLY makes create-config.sh executable and runs it.
  # All other static files (index.html, app.module.js) are assumed to be
  # already in the root directory and will be published by Netlify.
  command = "chmod +x create-config.sh && ./create-config.sh"
